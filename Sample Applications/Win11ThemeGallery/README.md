## WPF Fluent Windows Gallery Application
The application is a control catalog, containing various controls, their variations and appearance in FluentWindows style. The application is still a work in progress, with occasional irregularities in sample codes of some controls.

Developers need to do the following changes in order to use this application:
1. Update `sdk`'s `version` to latest 9 preview, or the one available in local system, in `global.json` present in the repository root.
2. Build a local WPF repository and update the `WpfRepoRoot` with it's path in `Win11ThemeGallery.csproj` file.
